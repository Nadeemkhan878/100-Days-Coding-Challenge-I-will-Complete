// Hey @everyone 👋  
// 🚀 *Day 2 Challenge: Start Coding!* 🚀
// *Question 1:* Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. 
// Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, 
// including the quotation marks:
// "Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"
// *Explain & TIP:* Simply choose a quote you like and show it with who said it. It's about combining text.
// *Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!*
console.log("Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new");
// *Question 2:* Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 1, but this time store the famous 
// person’s name in a variable called famous_person. 
// Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.
// *Explain & TIP:* First, save the author's name in a variable.
var author = "Albert Einstein";
//  Next, create your quote message in another variable.
//  Then, show it. This teaches you to organize and use your data with variables.
var quote = "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new";
// *Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!*
console.log("".concat(author, " Once Said ").concat(quote));
// *Question 3:* Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning 
// and end of the name. Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. 
// Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
// Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.
// *Explain & TIP:* Save a name with extra spaces or new lines around it. 
var personname = "\tNadeemkhan\n";
// Show it first with the extra space, then remove the spaces and show it clean. This helps you learn how to clean up text.
console.log(personname.trim());
console.log(personname);
// *Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!*
